# Amazon_Product_Reviews
Capstone Project 3
Amazon is widely used to purchase several types of products. Amazon has revolutionized techmology with its electronics, review system, and many more features and services. My goal is to create a model where we can predict the star rating/whether the review is positive or negative using natural language processing techniques.
## Data Acquisition
I found the datasets on dataworld and they were collected by datafiniti (a database with information about several products, businesses and property listings from all corners of the internet)
